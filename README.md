Forecast Video Game Demand

A video game producer is planning production levels. You will use time series forecasting models to forecast monthly demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand. We will compare Time Series Models like ETS and ARIMA, and how those models will be adapted in terms of performance with the error measeures and the AIC.

In this project we have three Alteryx workflows, one for ETS model and the holdhout sample, another with the ARIMA model with the holdhout sample, and the Final Solution workflow with the ARIMA and ETS model with the validation Sample.
